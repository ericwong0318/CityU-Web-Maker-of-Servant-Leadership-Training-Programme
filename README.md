 Web Maker of Servant Leadership Training Programme of CityU

I used to be a member of Web Maker team of Servant Leadership Training
Programme of CityU. I delivered the webpage design service for NGO and the following
is the website my team had made [基督教播道會興田邨道真堂愛禮信長者中心](http://efcchtalec.org.hk/) which made by Elementor, a page
builder of WordPress. I learned how to find out the need of users, such as making a
button to increase font size for the elderly because they might have Presbyopia. It is a
concern that I probably did not realize but important for user-friendly. In addition, I
had to communicate with NGO staff with no technical background and understand
their expectation and enquired for clarification. As the result, I learn the method to
cooperate with non-technical people.
